MGRA 
======

Version: 2.1 

Release date: 29 March 2014

Description
-----------
MGRA (Multiple Genome Rearrangements and Ancestors) -- a tool to recover ancestral genomes and the history of genomic rearrangements across multiple input genomes . the input is a phylogenetic tree , whose leaves are given genomes of organisms that are represented as gene sequences (or synteny blocks ), MGRA reconstruct their ancestral genomes in all internal tree nodes. Designed tool MGRA2, which is the second generation of MGRA, support genomes , where along with the genomic rearrangements insertions and deletions of genes are possible. Also in MGRA2 existing algorithms are improved and new steps are added to restore genomic rearrangements in tricky cases when they "break" the gene in the same points(so-called breakpoint reuse).

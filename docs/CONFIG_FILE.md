Configure file description
==========================

MGRA requires a plain text file describing the problem instance and related options ("configuration").
The configuration file should describe follow sections:

###[Genomes]

Each genome may have a multiple aliases by which it is recognized in the synteny blocks data; but the main/first alias is priority name which MGRA will use to denote multicolors and in output files.

###[Trees]

A phylogenetic tree may be given as a single tree in the Newick format: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format
